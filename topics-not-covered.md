These are topics from the lecture we either did not get to implement in time or did not make sense for our problem.

# Would have made sense
- _Importance Sampling_ our the Neural Network Classifier
- _Neural Network_ regressor
- _Neuro-probabilistic models_, though they seemed very difficult
- _Permutation Importance_ or _Additive Feature Attribution_, though we already have _Multiple Signal Analysis_ with autoencoder

# Don't make sense for our application
- Bayesian Surrogate Models
